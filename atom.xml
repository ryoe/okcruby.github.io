<p>Interested in how you can take your ruby skills and get the #1 paid app in the Apple App Store? We are too! That is why we&rsquo;ve summoned Amir Rajan (<a href="http://amirrajan.net">b</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/amirrajan">t</a>) to talk about RubyMotion and his app &ldquo;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a-dark-room/id736683061?mt=8">A Dark Room</a>&rdquo;.  Amir will show us the beauty and elegance of using ruby instead of objective-c to build your app as well as the meteoric rise of A Dark Room.</p>

<p>Amir (<a href="http://amirrajan.net">b</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/amirrajan">t</a>) is a polyglot superstar. Having cut his teeth in the deep waters of .Net, Amir has also sailed his code-ship into the watery regions of Nodejs, Ruby, objective C and others. Showing his commitment to okcruby, he will pack up nearly all of his possessions and travel to tell us about his odyssey with A Dark Room.</p>

<p>This month, we&rsquo;re celebrating Railsconf by having our own Railsconf speaker Jeremy Green talk about Service Oriented Authentication. Getting started with authentication in SOA environments can seem like a daunting subject, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be difficult. This talk will cover everything you need to know to get started building your own SOA systems. We&rsquo;ll look at the details of building a centralized authentication service and allowing other apps to delegate their authentication needs to the service.</p>

<p>Jeremy (<a href="https://twitter.com/jagthedrummer">@jagthedrummer</a> / <a href="http://www.octolabs.com">Octolabs</a>) is a full stack engineer who has been creating web apps for over 15 years. He&rsquo;s an organizer of the OkcRuby developer group and an active open source contributor. You might also find him drumming, shooting photos, or brewing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>February 13th Meeting</h4>

<p>Buckle up your SSH certs, because we&rsquo;re launching February with a talk on Capistrano.</p>

<p>Kelly Mahan is going to bring us the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>With our move to ruby and rails we needed a better way to deploy our applications to remote servers. Capistrano is a better way. I&rsquo;ll walkthrough a simple standard setup. Then I&rsquo;ll show off some of our more complex deployment scripts and automation. Finally I&rsquo;ll touch on some of the new stuff with Capistrano 3 and the direction that it is heading.﻿</p></blockquote>

<p>Kelly Mahan (<a href="https://twitter.com/kmahan">t</a>) will be the voice box for this talk. He&rsquo;s have been a professional web developer / jack of all trades for the past 16 years, but programming since way back when the TRS-80 and tape decks were all the rage. He started out with windows servers, asp, access databases, then picked up flash action-script and javascript to round out his interface skills. Around 2006 while working at Digimedia.com, the dev team made a group decision to learn Rails. Ruby is still his development tool of choice with Rails his goto for more complex web applications.</p>

actual number today was about 40, and everyone was very enthusiastic.<br/>
It&rsquo;s really awesome to see so much excitement in the local Ruby community.</p>

to change that. Starting October 10th, we&rsquo;re going to be meeting the 2nd Thursday of each
