In late August 2013 a few Ruby hackers in the OKC area decided that the
Ruby scene had been dormant for far too long.  They set out to change
that by forming okcruby, with the hopes that it would be a good way for
Oklahoma Rubyists to connect and share ideas. We hope you will join us.  

OKC Ruby meets the 2nd Thursday of every month, 11:30-12:30 at The Exchange

#### Code of Conduct
We expect all okcruby participants to help us realize a safe and positive experience for everyone. At all meetings and social events we expect everyone will:  

**Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.**  

**Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.**  

**Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert meeting organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.**  

**Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to create okcruby and make it your own.**  

Unacceptable behaviors include harassing, abusive, discriminatory, or derogatory conduct. Harassment includes: offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of sexual images (including in presentations); deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  

These behaviors will not be tolerated and anyone asked to stop is expected to comply immediately. If a participant behaves unacceptably, the conference organizers may take action they deem appropriate, including expulsion from the conference without warning or refund.
