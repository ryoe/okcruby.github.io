### September 14th Meeting

We're trying something a little different this month! Instead of a
formal presentation from a single speaker, we're going to have a
round-table style discussion.  The topic will be "Is TDD really dead?" and we'll
talk about various philosopies and approaches that are commonly taken
with automated testing. We'll discuss what to test, and what not to test, when in the dev cycle
tests should be written, when they should be run, how they affect
deployment, and how they affect development.  Come join in the
discussion!

Location: [Prototek][prototek]
Time: 11:30 - 12:30

{Jeremy, Michael, Paul, Rob}
