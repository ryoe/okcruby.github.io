Thanks to everyone who came to the first meeting.  We were blown
away by the turn out.  When we first started plannig the meeting we
guessed that there might be around 15-20 people in attendance.  The 
actual number today was about 40, and everyone was very enthusiastic.  
It's really awesome to see so much excitement in the local Ruby community.

Here are links to the slides for todays presentations.
